This solution solves for maximum path sum in a triangle of integer values.
Path starts at the top of the triangle and moves to adjacent numbers on the row below, following the maximum total from top to bottom.


Project is written mainly for experimenting with TDD approach.

XUnit, autofixture, Moq and fluentassertions are used for unit tests.
